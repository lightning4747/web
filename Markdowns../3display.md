Absolutely! Let's go step by step. In CSS, the `display` property controls **how an element is rendered in the layout**. You said you want to exclude `flex` and `grid` for now, so we’ll focus on other common `display` values.

---

## 1. `display: block;`

```css
div {
  display: block;
}
```

* **Behavior:**

  * Element takes up the **full width** of its container.
  * Starts on a **new line**.
  * You can set `width` and `height`.
* **Examples:** `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` are block elements by default.
* **Use case:** For sections, paragraphs, and any element that should stack vertically.

---

## 2. `display: inline;`

```css
span {
  display: inline;
}
```

* **Behavior:**

  * Element takes only **as much width as needed**.
  * Does **not start on a new line**.
  * `width` and `height` **cannot** be set.
* **Examples:** `<span>`, `<a>` are inline elements by default.
* **Use case:** Styling text within a paragraph or links.

---

## 3. `display: inline-block;`

```css
button {
  display: inline-block;
}
```

* **Behavior:**

  * Combines **inline and block** properties.
  * Does **not start on a new line** (like inline).
  * You **can set width and height** (like block).
* **Use case:** Buttons, small containers that should sit next to each other but still have dimensions.

---

## 4. `display: none;`

```css
.hide {
  display: none;
}
```

* **Behavior:**

  * Completely **removes the element** from the layout.
  * No space is taken.
* **Use case:** Hiding elements dynamically (like a dropdown menu that is initially hidden).

---

## 5. `display: inline-table;`

```css
table {
  display: inline-table;
}
```

* **Behavior:**

  * Behaves like a `<table>` element.
  * Layout is like `table` but flows inline with text.
* **Use case:** Rare, mostly when you need table-like layout but want it inline with other elements.

---

## 6. `display: list-item;`

```css
li {
  display: list-item;
}
```

* **Behavior:**

  * Behaves like a **block element**, but also generates a **bullet or numbering**.
* **Examples:** `<li>` elements in `<ul>` or `<ol>` lists.
* **Use case:** Lists, menus.

---

## 7. `display: run-in;` *(less common, not widely supported)*

* **Behavior:**

  * An element behaves as a **block or inline** depending on the next element.
* **Use case:** Rarely used due to inconsistent browser support.

---

### ⚡ Notes:

* `display` determines the **fundamental layout behavior** of an element.
* Before using `flex` or `grid`, most layouts historically relied on `block`, `inline-block`, `inline`, and `float` (another technique).
* Understanding these basics is crucial because **all other modern layout systems build on these principles**.
